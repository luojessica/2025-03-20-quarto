Preamble:
- quarto websites are a good way to start research portfolio

Lecture notes:
- `which` is a bash command (not for windows; where instead of which)
  - this is the name of a program, where is the location of it?
  - e.g. `which quarto`, `which R`, `which python`, `which make`
- the `--version` is a command line flag that provides the version as an output
